## Learn the conditional constructs with Leo and Audrianna in French.

### Summary:

In English: I would speak (je parlerais)

Take the infinitive form of the verb and add the imperfect endings (same ones for all verbs, regular and irregular). For -re verbs, you take the infinitive, remove the -e and add the imperfect endings

**Used for:** expressing what would happen in the future (if a certain condition is met), expressing hypotheses, making requests more polite

### Usage:

Polite requests

 **Est-ce que tu pourrais m’aider?** *Could you help me?*
 **Voudriez-vous venir chez nous demain?** *Would you like to come to our place tomorrow?*
 **Pourrais-tu m’expliquer ce mot?** *Could you explain this word to me?*
